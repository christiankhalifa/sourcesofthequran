    “There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-‘Imran, and he used to write for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: ‘Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.’” — <em>Sahih Bukhari 3617</em>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #1a202c; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The Qur’an claims to be a divine revelation, yet it openly acknowledges that the Prophet Muhammad often acted as an <strong>“ear”</strong> — a receiver and reteller of stories from previous peoples. For instance, the Qur’an describes Muhammad as:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="background: #f7fafc; border-left: 4px solid #3182ce; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic; color: #2d3748;">
      “And indeed, you (O Muhammad) are hearing (an ear) of the truth from Him in truth; a bearer of good news and a warner.” <br/>
      <small style="display:block; margin-top: 0.25rem;">(Qur’an 25:5)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote style="background: #f7fafc; border-left: 4px solid #3182ce; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic; color: #2d3748;">
      “You are not (engaged) in any affairs, but We are a watcher over you.”<br/>
      <small style="display:block; margin-top: 0.25rem;">(Qur’an 28:48)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      More explicitly, it states:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="background: #f7fafc; border-left: 4px solid #3182ce; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic; color: #2d3748;">
      “We did not teach him [Muhammad] poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is only a Message and a clear Qur’an.”<br/>
      <small style="display:block; margin-top: 0.25rem;">(Qur’an 36:69–70)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This demonstrates that Muhammad was not a poet or original author but a transmitter of messages, many of which the Qur’an itself admits are based on ancient narratives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the Qur’an, numerous stories—such as those of Adam and Satan (2:30–34), Noah’s people (71:1–28), Moses and Pharaoh (28:3), and Solomon and the hoopoe bird (27:20–28)—closely parallel Jewish, Christian, and apocryphal legends circulating long before the Qur’an’s compilation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Sources of the Qur’an</strong> focuses on identifying parallels with lesser-known Jewish and Christian apocryphal texts, legends, and oral traditions because the Qur’an extensively borrows from the Torah and the Gospel, which are well-known and easily accessible. Therefore, those primary sources are not exhaustively cited here, as their influence on the Qur’an is already clear and widely recognized.
    </p>

    <p>
      By exploring these connections, this site challenges the claim that the Qur’an is an entirely original revelation and encourages readers to reconsider its historical and literary origins.

      <h2>Satan’s Downfall: Refusal to Prostrate to Man</h2>
      <p class="verse">Qur’an 2:30–34</p>
      <blockquote>
        Allah said to the angels, “I will place a vicegerent on earth.”  
        They said, “Will You place someone who will cause corruption and shed blood?”  
        Allah said, “I know what you do not know.”  
        He taught Adam the names… and asked the angels to name them.  
        When they could not, He told Adam to inform them.  
        Then Allah said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” and they all did — except Satan, who refused and was arrogant.

      <p class="quote">Both Qur’an 2:258 and Genesis Rabbah 38:13 depict a confrontation between Abraham and King Nimrod, emphasizing the theme of human arrogance versus divine authority. In both narratives, Nimrod claims power over life, death, or the elements, while Abraham counters by asserting that only God possesses ultimate control. Abraham’s steadfast monotheism is highlighted through reasoned argument: in Genesis Rabbah, he debates the elements (fire, water, clouds, wind, humans), and in the Qur’an, he challenges Nimrod rhetorically by asking him to bring the sun from the west.</p>

        The Qur’an’s account of Mary giving birth under a palm tree and being nourished by dates and a spring 
        parallels apocryphal traditions. The Protoevangelium of James (2nd century) places the birth of Jesus 
        in a remote desert place, while the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (7th century) describes a miracle of a 
        palm tree bending to give Mary fruit and a spring bursting forth at Jesus’ command.

        Both the Qur’an and the Second Targum of Esther tell the story of the Queen of Sheba getting a letter from Solomon, asking her to submit. She talks to her advisors, sends gifts, and eventually visits Solomon. In both, she’s amazed by his power and wisdom. The Qur’an shows her throne being miraculously brought to Solomon and her mistaking a glass floor for water, lifting her dress. The Targum has the same glass-floor moment, but adds that Solomon sees her hairy legs and calls it shameful for a woman. That detail isn’t in the Qur’an, but later Islamic commentary picks it up and says demons helped her remove the hair. So the Targum is more direct and descriptive about the hairy legs part, while the Qur’an keeps it subtle and symbolic. Both end with her praising God and recognizing Solomon’s greatness.
