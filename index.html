        <b>2:30.</b> When your Lord said to the angels, “I am placing a successor on earth.” They said, 
        “Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare 
        Your praises and sanctify You?” He said, “I know what you do not know.”<br><br>

        <b>2:31.</b> And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then He presented them to the angels and said, 
        “Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.”

      <p class="quote">
        Solomon loved the hoopoe, and when the bird vanished, he said, “Why do I not see the hoopoe? Is he among the absentees?” Eventually the hoopoe returned and informed Solomon about a queen in Sheba who worshipped the sun, and Solomon sent her a letter inviting her to the worship of the true God.
